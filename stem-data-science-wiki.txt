data scienc is a multi-disciplinari field that use scientif method , process , algorithm and system to extract knowledg and insight from structur and unstructur data . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] data scienc is the same concept as data mine and big data : `` use the most power hardwar , the most power program system , and the most effici algorithm to solv problem '' . [ 3 ] data scienc is a `` concept to unifi statist , data analysi , machin learn and their relat method '' in order to `` understand and analyz actual phenomena '' with data . [ 4 ] It employ techniqu and theori drawn from mani field within the context of mathemat , statist , comput scienc , and inform scienc . ture award winner jim gray imagin data scienc as a `` fourth paradigm '' of scienc ( empir , theoret , comput and now data-driven ) and assert that `` everyth about scienc is chang becaus of the impact of inform technolog '' and the data delug . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In 2012 , when harvard busi review call it `` the sexiest job of the 21st centuri '' , [ 7 ] the term `` data scienc '' becam a buzzword . It is now often use interchang with earlier concept like busi analyt , [ 8 ] busi intellig , predict model , and statist . even the suggest that data scienc is sexi wa paraphras han rosl , featur in a 2011 bbc documentari with the quot , `` statist is now the sexiest subject around . `` [ 9 ] nate silver refer to data scienc as a sex up term for statist . [ 10 ] In mani case , earlier approach and solut are now simpli rebrand as `` data scienc '' to be more attract , which can caus the term to becom `` dilut [ d ] beyond use . `` [ 11 ] while mani univers program now offer a data scienc degre , there exist no consensu on a definit or suitabl curriculum content . [ 8 ] To it discredit , howev , mani data-sci and big-data project fail to deliv use result , often as a result of poor manag and util of resourc . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] the term `` data scienc '' ha appear in variou context over the past thirti year but did not becom an establish term until recent . In an earli usag , it wa use as a substitut for comput scienc by peter naur in 1960 . naur later introduc the term `` datalog '' . [ 16 ] In 1974 , naur publish concis survey of comput method , which freeli use the term data scienc in it survey of the contemporari data process method that are use in a wide rang of applic . In 1996 , member of the intern feder of classif societi ( ifc ) met in kobe for their biennial confer . here , for the first time , the term data scienc is includ in the titl of the confer ( `` data scienc , classif , and relat method '' ) , [ 17 ] after the term wa introduc in a roundtabl discuss by chikio hayashi . [ 4 ] In novemb 1997 , c.f . jeff Wu gave the inaugur lectur entitl `` statist = data scienc ? `` [ 18 ] for hi appoint to the H. C. carver professorship at the univers of michigan . [ 19 ] In thi lectur , he character statist work as a trilog of data collect , data model and analysi , and decis make . In hi conclus , he initi the modern , non-comput scienc , usag of the term `` data scienc '' and advoc that statist be renam data scienc and statistician data scientist . [ 18 ] later , he present hi lectur entitl `` statist = data scienc ? '' as the first of hi 1998 p.c . mahalanobi memori lectur . [ 20 ] these lectur honor prasanta chandra mahalanobi , an indian scientist and statistician and founder of the indian statist institut . In 2001 , william S. cleveland introduc data scienc as an independ disciplin , extend the field of statist to incorpor `` advanc in comput with data '' in hi articl `` data scienc : An action plan for expand the technic area of the field of statist , '' which wa publish in volum 69 , No . 1 , of the april 2001 edit of the intern statist review / revu international de statistiqu . [ 21 ] In hi report , cleveland establish six technic area which he believ to encompass the field of data scienc : multidisciplinari investig , model and method for data , comput with data , pedagogi , tool evalu , and theori . In april 2002 , the intern council for scienc ( icsu ) : committe on data for scienc and technolog ( codata ) [ 22 ] start the data scienc journal , [ 23 ] a public focus on issu such as the descript of data system , their public on the internet , applic and legal issu . [ 24 ] shortli thereaft , in januari 2003 , columbia univers began publish the journal of data scienc , [ 25 ] which provid a platform for all data worker to present their view and exchang idea . the journal wa larg devot to the applic of statist method and quantit research . In 2005 , the nation scienc board publish `` long-liv digit data collect : enabl research and educ in the 21st centuri '' defin data scientist as `` the inform and comput scientist , databas and softwar and programm , disciplinari expert , curat and expert annot , librarian , archivist , and other , who are crucial to the success manag of a digit data collect '' whose primari activ is to `` conduct creativ inquiri and analysi . `` [ 26 ] around 2007 , [ citat need ] ture award winner jim gray envis `` data-driven scienc '' as a `` fourth paradigm '' of scienc that use the comput analysi of larg data as primari scientif method [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and `` to have a world in which all of the scienc literatur is onlin , all of the scienc data is onlin , and they interoper with each other . `` [ 27 ] In the 2012 harvard busi review articl `` data scientist : the sexiest job of the 21st centuri '' , [ 7 ] DJ patil claim to have coin thi term in 2008 with jeff hammerbach to defin their job at linkedin and facebook , respect . He assert that a data scientist is `` a new breed '' , and that a `` shortag of data scientist is becom a seriou constraint in some sector '' , but describ a much more business-ori role . In 2013 , the ieee task forc on data scienc and advanc analyt [ 28 ] wa launch . In 2013 , the first `` european confer on data analysi ( ecda ) '' wa organis in luxembourg , establish the european associ for data scienc ( euad ) . the first intern confer : ieee intern confer on data scienc and advanc analyt wa launch in 2014 . [ 29 ] In 2014 , gener assembl launch student-paid bootcamp and the data incub launch a competit free data scienc fellowship . [ 30 ] In 2014 , the american statist associ section on statist learn and data mine renam it journal to `` statist analysi and data mine : the asa data scienc journal '' and in 2016 chang it section name to `` statist learn and data scienc '' . [ 31 ] In 2015 , the intern journal on data scienc and analyt [ 32 ] wa launch by springer to publish origin work on data scienc and big data analyt . In septemb 2015 the gesellschaft f√ºr klassifik ( gfkl ) ad to the name of the societi `` data scienc societi '' at the third ecda confer at the univers of essex , colchest , UK .
