Even the suggestion that data science is sexy was paraphrasing Hans Rosling, featured in a 2011 BBC documentary with the quote, \"Statistics is now the sexiest subject around.\"[9] Nate Silver referred to data science as a sexed up term for statistics.[10] In many cases, earlier approaches and solutions are now simply rebranded as \"data science\" to be more attractive, which can cause the term to become \"dilute[d] beyond usefulness.\"[11] While many university programs now offer a data science degree, there exists no consensus on a definition or suitable curriculum contents.[8] To its discredit, however, many data-science and big-data projects fail to deliver useful results, often as a result of poor management and utilization of resources.[12][13][14][15]\\n',\n",

In his conclusion, he initiated the modern, non-computer science, usage of the term \"data science\" and advocated that statistics be renamed data science and statisticians data scientists.[18] Later, he presented his lecture entitled \"Statistics = Data Science?\" as the first of his 1998 P.C.

The journal was largely devoted to the application of statistical methods and quantitative research. In 2005, The National Science Board published \"Long-lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century\" defining data scientists as \"the information and computer scientists, database and software and programmers, disciplinary experts, curators and expert annotators, librarians, archivists, and others, who are crucial to the successful management of a digital data collection\" whose primary activity is to \"conduct creative inquiry and analysis.\"[26]\\n',\n",
